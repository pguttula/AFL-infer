\section*{Problem 1}
  \subsection*{Sub-problem a}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Solution:\\
  $P(\text{second card is heart$|$first card is heart)})$\\
  = $P\text{(second card is heart)}$ (as probability of drawing second card is
  independent of first card being a heart)
  = $\frac{12}{51}$
  \item Solution: \\
  $P(\text{none of the cards are hearts$|$atmost one card is heart})$ = \\
  $\frac {P\text{(none of the cards are hearts,atmost one card is
  heart)}}
  {P\text{(atmost one card is heart)}}$ \\
  $P\text{(none of the cards are hearts,atmost one card is
    heart)} = P(\text{none of the cards are hearts})$ \\
  $P(\text{none of the cards are hearts}) = \frac{39}{52}$\\
  ${P\text{(atmost one card is heart)}} = 1 - {P\text{(atleast one card
  is heart)}}$ \\
  ${P\text{(atleast one card is heart)}} = \frac{1}{13}$ \\
  ${P\text{(atmost one card is heart)}} = 1 - \frac{1}{13} =
  \frac{12}{13}$\\
  $P(\text{none of the cards are hearts$|$atmost one card is
  heart})$ = $\frac{\frac{39}{52}}{\frac{12}{13}} = \frac{3}{4}$
  \end{enumerate}
  \subsection*{Sub-problem b}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Solution:\\
  $P(\text{card drawn from second deck is ace})$ = \\
  $P(\text{card drawn from first deck is ace}) 
  + P(\text{card drawn from first deck is not ace})$\\
  = $\frac{48}{52}\times\frac{4}{53} + \frac{4}{52}\times\frac{5}{53}$
  = $0.0769$
  \item Solution:\\
  $P(\text{card drawn from second deck is ace})$ = \\
  $P(\text{card drawn from first deck is ace}) 
  +P(\text{card drawn from first deck is not ace})$\\
  = $\frac{48}{52}\times\frac{4}{55} + \frac{4}{52}\times\frac{5}{55}$
  = $0.0741$
  \item Solution:\\
  $P(\text{ace was transferred from first deck$|$ace was drawn from
  second deck)})$\\
  = $\frac{P(\text{ace was transferred from first deck, ace was drawn from
  second deck})}{P(\text{ace was drawn from second deck})}$\\
  $P(\text{ace was transferred from first deck, ace was drawn from
    second deck}) = \frac{4}{52}\times\frac{5}{55}$\\
  $P(\text{ace was drawn from second deck}) =
  \frac{48}{52}\times\frac{4}{55} + \frac{4}{52}\times\frac{5}{55}$\\
  (We have calculated the probability of drawing an ace from the
  second deck in the previous problem b.2)\\

  $P(\text{ace was transferred from first deck$|$ace was drawn from
    second deck)})$\\
  =
  $\frac{\frac{4}{52}\times\frac{5}{55}}{\frac{48}{52}\times\frac{4}{55}
  + \frac{4}{52}\times\frac{5}{55}}$
  $= 0.094$
  \end{enumerate}
